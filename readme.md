## Server setup

We use a server on AWS, Frankfurt:

* Elastic IP: 3.125.105.230
* Instance type: t2.micro

## Code structure

The docker setup currently is based on my [ghost.docker.image](https://bitbucket.org/tgartner/ghost.docker.image/src/master/), with additional, website specific configurations. 

## Code to server

We maintain all the settings of the ghost installation as docker based settings within THIS repository. The content (i.e. the ghost-content and ghost-database) are NOT within this repo (i.e. thos directories are liste in `.gitignore`). 

From here to the server all we need to do:

```shell
# Login to server
ssh ubuntu@ghost.de

# Shutdown currently running docker ghost network
cd ghost
docker-compose down

# Get new version
git fetch

# Restart
docker-compose up --build
```
